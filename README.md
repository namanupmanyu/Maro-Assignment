DevOps Assignment – Ruby Sample Application

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📌 Project Overview
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This repository showcases a sample Ruby on Rails application developed as part of a DevOps assignment. 
The project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle, including:

• Source code management  
• Continuous Integration and Deployment  
• Infrastructure provisioning  
• Configuration management  
• Docker Compose-based deployment and rollback on AWS  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Language: Ruby on Rails  
• Version Control: Git & GitHub  
• CI/CD: Jenkins  
• Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose  
• Infrastructure Provisioning: Terraform (AWS EC2)  
• Configuration Management: Ansible  
• Deployment: Docker container managed via Docker Compose on EC2  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔍 Ruby on Rails and MVC Architecture
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Ruby on Rails (RoR) is a web development framework that follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

• Model: Manages data and business logic.  
• View: Handles presentation and user interface.  
• Controller: Coordinates between the view and model, handling user input.  

This architecture ensures the application is modular, maintainable, and scalable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌿 Branching Strategy
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔸 main:  
• The production branch  
• Only stable, tested, and approved code is merged here.  
• Jenkins is triggered on changes to this branch.  

🔸 dev:  
• Previously used for development and testing.  
• Not connected to the deployment pipeline anymore.  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔁 CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch on GitHub (via webhook)  
• Builds the Docker image for the Ruby on Rails application  
• Tags and pushes the image to Docker Hub  
• Uses Docker Compose to deploy the latest image on the EC2 instance  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🐳 Docker & Docker Compose
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• The application is containerized using Docker  
• Docker Compose is used to manage the deployment on EC2  
• Supports simple rollback by changing image tags in the Compose file  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🌩 Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Provisions AWS EC2 with a public IP and security groups  
• Infrastructure as code ensures consistency and repeatability  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚙️ Configuration Management (Ansible)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Automates installation of Docker and Docker Compose on EC2  
• Ensures consistent server configuration  

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 Deployment Workflow
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Developer merges tested code into the main branch  
2. GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins pipeline  
3. Docker image is built, tagged, and pushed to Docker Hub  
4. EC2 pulls the latest image  
5. Docker Compose deploys the app

📚 Learnings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Ruby on Rails MVC architecture  
• Automating CI/CD with Jenkins  
• Managing containers with Docker and Docker Compose  
• Provisioning infrastructure using Terraform  
• Server setup using Ansible  
• Real-world DevOps workflow and deployment best practices  


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ Challenges Faced
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ Manual Container Management with Docker Run  
Initially, we were using `docker run` to deploy the application on the EC2 instance.  
This approach had the following limitations:  
• Manual execution for every update  
• Lack of version tracking and rollback options  
• Increased risk of errors during deployment  
To resolve this, we adopted **Docker Compose**, which simplified deployment and rollback by using a structured YAML file and supporting zero-downtime updates.

2️⃣ Using Ansible for the First Time  
This was the first time Ansible was used in the workflow.  
Challenges included:  
• Learning YAML syntax for playbooks  
• Understanding host file configuration  
• Managing SSH keys and remote connectivity  
Overcoming these helped automate server setup and improved consistency across environments.

✅ How to Run the Project
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
- git clone <your-repo-url>  

2️⃣ Provision Infrastructure Using Terraform  
- terraform init  
- terraform validate  
- terraform plan  
- terraform apply  

3️⃣ Configure EC2 Instance with Ansible  
Sample host file:  
[web]  
<your-ec2-public-ip> ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=path/to/key.pem  

Run the playbook:  
- ansible-playbook -i host playbook.yml  

4️⃣ Push Code to GitHub  
- Push your latest, stable application code to the main branch  

5️⃣ Jenkins Pipeline Execution  
- Jenkins automatically builds, tags, and pushes the image, then deploys with Docker Compose  

6️⃣ Deployment Using Docker Compose on EC2  
- docker pull your-dockerhub-username/image-name:tag  
- docker-compose up -d

🔗 Set Up Jenkins Webhook & AWS Access
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📌 Create a GitHub Webhook for Jenkins  
1️⃣ Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook  
2️⃣ Enter your Jenkins URL followed by `/github-webhook/` (e.g., `http://<your-jenkins-server>/github-webhook/`)  
3️⃣ Choose `application/json` as the content type  
4️⃣ Select `Just the push event`  
5️⃣ Click "Add Webhook"  

✅ Make sure your Jenkins server is accessible from the internet (use a public IP or domain name).

🔐 Generate AWS Access Keys for Terraform  
1️⃣ Open AWS Console → IAM → Users → Add User  
2️⃣ Enter a username and enable “Programmatic access”  
3️⃣ Assign policies like `AmazonEC2FullAccess`  
4️⃣ Complete and **download** the `.csv` file with the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**  
5️⃣ Run the following command to configure locally:
